# üß≠ Travel Reimbursement Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)

---

## üß† Overview
This project models the **University Travel Reimbursement process** using **Neo4j**, a graph database built for relationship-driven analytics.  
It demonstrates how financial and administrative entities interact across multiple hierarchical layers of approval, auditing, and reimbursement.  

With this graph model, users can visualize how **Travelers**, **Departments**, and **Financial Offices** interconnect, enabling data-driven analysis of workflow efficiency and compliance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
- Constructed a **Neo4j-based graph model** using Cypher queries and dataset imports (CSV).  
- Modeled **real-world entities** ‚Äì Traveler, Department, Financial Services, and Policy.  
- Implemented relationship types like `REQUESTS`, `AUDITS`, `APPROVES`, and `REIMBURSES`.  
- Solved **cross-platform CSV ingestion issues** (Windows vs macOS compatibility).  
- Designed **queries and patterns** to analyze workflow dependencies and bottlenecks.
